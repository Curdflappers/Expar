Made to learn about maintaining data across scenes in Unity, C# data structures and manipulation, have fun

Description:
Top-down shooter with three types of enemies. Collect scrap from the dead bodies of your robot enemies and use it to build guns. Working proof-of-concept right now, I'll be adding more steadily.

Plans:
Add structures. Build structures on a grid-based system in-between rounds with scrap. Can be walls, traps, triggers, explosions, turrets, health packs, you name it.

More guns. Homing rocket launcher, grenade launcher, etc.

Lots more later I'm sure. Maybe an actual story, reason to venture outward, etc.? Right now I'll focus on implementing structures.
